  How to install Ares on Windows
  </Summary>

On windows, you simply run install.bat and it will attempt to install all the pre-requisites automatically. By attempting to use python without having to rely on PATH

If the script fails make sure you have both python and pip added to PATH.
You can make sure you've done this by running the python installer again and checking the checkbox that says `Add python 3.X to PATH` (See image below)

```bash
# Download Ares
git clone https://github.com/GoByeBye/Ares.git
cd Ares
# Install requirements
sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

```
